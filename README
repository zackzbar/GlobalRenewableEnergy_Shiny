Global Renewable Energy; 1990-2015

A Shiny app designed to explore Global Renewable Energy data from the World Bank's Sustainable Energy For All initiative.

The main files are:

ui.R, server.R, global.R - for the Shiny app
clean11.csv - the final cleaned dataset

Note - clean11.csv was downloaded from the World Bank, cleaned/edited for ease of analysis, and joined with GDP and Population datasets also downloaded from the World Bank. All links are cited in the Data page of the Shiny app.
